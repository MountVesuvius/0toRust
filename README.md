# 0 to Rust
#### Learning Rust, one small project at a time

I've tried using rustlings, reading through "the book", doing leet code questions, but it just isn't a great way to learn a language. Therefore, I am pulling a bunch of old assignments from school/university/etc. from when I was first learning to code, and just remaking them.

"Best way to learn something new is through the lens of something old." - Some Guy, Some Time

Feel free to have a snoop if you're trying to learn Rust, and or want some easy projects/tasks to start learning a different language.

**Note:**
I am just doing `cargo new <project_name>` when it comes to each task. If you want to cram everything into one project be my guest. I just don't want to wait 6 hours for everything to compile however many months down the road when there are loads of crates for each project. Compartmentalize people.

## Project List
